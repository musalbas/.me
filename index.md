title: Who am I?
---

My name is Fares Alaboud. I'm a first-year computer science student at King's College London. 

The list of things I enjoy include:

**reading**
As long as the book I'm reading is not on my course syllabus.

**attending the theatre**
I've attended Mamma Mia and Wicked. I've enjoyed both, very greatly, but unfortunately never get the opportunity to.

**baking** 
I'm even part of [my university's backing society](https://www.facebook.com/KCLBakingSoc). I bake all kinds of desserts: from cookies to cheesecakes. My specialties are brownies.

**watching movies/going to the cinema**
I'm a fanatic of sci-fi movies. My favourite movie series is The Hunger Games (call me cliché) and my all-time-favourite is [Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236/).

**learning new programming languages**
I'm currently refreshing my memory on HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript & Python. Next up is jQuery, then PHP and Ruby. You can my progress on [my Codecademy profile](http://www.codecademy.com/faresalaboud).

**attending hackathons and tech-related events**
I've attended StartupWeekend, and [you can see a video of me at the event](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdVVdknnxcA). I am the first person and last person who talks in the video. I've also got three more on my list: [StudentHack](http://studenthack.com), [HackKings](http://hackkings.org) and another [StartupWeekend](http://london.startupweekend.org) event in April.

**traveling**
One of the things I enjoy the most: [traveling around the world](http://wolpy.com/faresalaboud/map) making friends and visiting new places.
