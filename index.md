My name is Fares Alaboud. I'm a second-year computer science student at King's College London. I tend to be found at tech events such as hackathons and talks, lectures or workshops.  

<br/>

I'm Vice President of [KCL Tech](http://kcltech.com), co-founder of [HackKing's](http://hackkings.org), co-founder of [UnituHack](http://unituhack.com) and the proud co-founder of [HackCard](http://hackcard.org).

<br/>

I [travel around the world](http://wolpy.com/faresalaboud/map), [enjoy learning new programming langues](http://www.codecademy.com/faresalaboud), and I absolutely love food.
