My name is Fares Alaboud. I'm a first-year computer science student at King's College London. 

The list of things I enjoy include baking, watching movies, going to the cinema, reading books (that are not on my course syllabus), attending the theatre, learning new programming languages, following tech news, attending hackathons and tech-related events, and [traveling around the world](http://wolpy.com/faresalaboud/map) making friends and visiting new places.
