title: Who am I?
---

My name is Fares Alaboud. I'm a first-year computer science student at King's College London. I'm active, outgoing, talkative and do my best to be helpful around others. I try to be very involved in my course and around campus. I tend to be found at tech events such as hackathons and talks, lectures or workshops.  

**<h3>Events</h3>**
 - February 6-7 2014: <s>StudentHack</s> And it was EPIC! [Read my blog post about it here](http://blog.faresalaboud.me/blog/studenthack).
 - February 22-23 2014: <s>HackKings</s> That's how we run hackathons. [Read my post on KCL Tech's blog here](http://blog.kcltech.com/2014/03/hackkings-we-got-it-right-first-time.html)!
 - March 8 2014: <s>The First Year hackChallenge</s> I ran my first hackathon for the first year in my course! [Read about it here: ](http://blog.faresalaboud.me/blog/hackChallenge).
 - March 17 2014: <s>The Tech Talk</s> I gave a talk on how startups, hackathons and programming are changing the world, and how to be involved. To find out how to get started with programming, [see my blog post here](http://blog.faresalaboud.me/blog/programming).
 
**<h3>The list of things I enjoy include:</h3>**

**Reading** <br/>
As long as the book I'm reading is not on my course syllabus.
<br/><br/>
**Attending the theatre** <br/>
I've attended Mamma Mia and Wicked. I've enjoyed both, very greatly, but unfortunately never get the opportunity to attend more plays.
<br/><br/>
**Baking** <br/>
I'm even part of [my university's baking society](https://www.facebook.com/KCLBakingSoc). I bake all kinds of desserts: from cookies to cheesecakes. My specialty is brownies.
<br/><br/>
**Watching movies/going to the cinema** <br/>
I'm a fanatic of sci-fi movies. My favourite movie series is The Hunger Games (call me cliche) and my all-time-favourite is [Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408236/).
<br/><br/>
**Learning new programming languages** <br/>
I'm currently refreshing my memory on HTML, and I'm learning JavaScript & Python. Next up is jQuery, then PHP and Ruby. You can track my progress on [my Codecademy profile](http://www.codecademy.com/faresalaboud). I'm also currently doing an online [Stanford University course on developing iOS applications for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550). I'm hoping to be done with that by March.
<br/><br/>
**Attending hackathons and tech-related events** <br/>
I've attended StartupWeekend, and [you can see a video of me at the event](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdVVdknnxcA). I am the first person and last person who talks in the video. I've also got three more on my list:, [HackKings](http://hackkings.org) and another [StartupWeekend](http://london.startupweekend.org) event in April.
<br/><br/>
**Traveling** <br/>
One of the things I enjoy the most: [traveling around the world](wolpy.com/faresalaboud/map) making friends and visiting new places.
