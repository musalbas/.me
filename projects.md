Being fans of the idea and technology behind the famous internet phenomenon: Bitcoin, [Mustafa Al-Bassam](http://twitter.com/musalbas) and I built an open-source mobile friendly web app that displays the highest-reached all-time-high price of Bitcoin, and records the history of all-time-high prices since the first Bitcoin transactions on an exchange. [You can find the source code here](http://github.com/musalbas/btcalltimehigh)
