**Web Development**
 - [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) is a brilliant website that has interactive and fun programming course. [I have my own profile](http://www.codecademy.com/faresalaboud) and I'm currently doing four of its courses!

**News**
 - [GSMArena](http://gsmarena.com) is the number one site for details about phones. It has a [brilliant comparison tool](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3) which you can use to compare two phones.
 - [The Verge](http://theverge.com/) is one of my preferred sources of tech related news.
 - [Softpedia](http://news.softpedia.com/) is my favourite news site. It takes articles from many sources, and has more than just tech news (but is mainly tech related.)
