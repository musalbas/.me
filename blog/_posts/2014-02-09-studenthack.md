I arrived in Manchester at 7:28pm on Friday night after the bumpy ride from London Euston. The trains are just ridiculously fast, and (I don't know if it's just me, but) they actually tilt sideways when taking a turn, like a rollercoaster. I got off the train, ran to the queue for a cab and rode to the hotel. The weather is so cold that, even inside the hotel room, I can't feel my fingers. I know it's because I'm nervous, it's my first [hackathon](https://medium.com/hackathons-anonymous/92668579601) after all. I slept and waited for the next morning to surprise me. And oh boy it did.

At around 6am, I woke up without my alarm going off. I know it's because my blood is fizzing with excitement. I took a shower, got dressed, dressed my best and left the hotel. It felt like I was walking to a merge of an exam and a wedding, where everyone would stare at me and expect me to do my best, where I would be judged on my performance and appearance. When I finally found the venue after around a half hour walk of being lost, I saw a beautiful glass building and thought: "I wish the hackathon was in there". I thought the building was so pretty that I decided I'll walk into there, because it had the Manchester Metropolitan University logo on it, and I knew that the university was hosting [StudentHack](http://studenthack.com). I just needed to find out in which of it's many buildings it was going to be.

Being as lost as I was, I found the side entrance walked into the building looking for someone to ask where StudentHack was held, when I saw the StudentHack banner. Behind that, I saw a massive vertical hall dominated by spacious round tables. I was somewhat early, but there was already around sixty or so students spread among the tables like children among toys on a playground. I sensed the thrill in everyone's low voices, but didn't have the courage to introduce myself. I was still waiting for [Mustafa](http://twitter.com/musalbas), a close friend who agreed to come to StudentHack with me. I silently walked up to a round table that had no one on it, and sat on my own for about two minutes, just taking note of my surroundings.  with a glass wall at the end of it, and a glass ceiling above it
